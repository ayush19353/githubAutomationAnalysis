Open the api.py file and insert the API key.
Environment Preparation:

Ensure that you have VS Code installed.
Install Streamlit within your VS Code environment.
Running the Program:

Execute the command "Streamlit run app.py" to run the analysis program.
Once the program starts successfully, a pop-up window will appear in your Chrome browser.
Repository Analysis:

In the pop-up window, enter the URL of your GitHub user repository (e.g., "https://github.com/ayush19353?tab=repositories").
Explore the provided information, including links to technically related repositories, explanations, and details such as title history and script history.
By following these steps, you will be able to set up and run the GitHub-Automated-Analysis program, enabling you to analyze and gain insights from your GitHub repositories effortlessly.
